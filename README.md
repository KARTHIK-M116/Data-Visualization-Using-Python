# Data-Visualization-Using-Python

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates fundamental data exploration techniques using Python. It covers numerical computations, matrix operations, and statistical calculations using the NumPy library.

## Features
- Creation of matrices with random integers
- Calculation of mean, median, and standard deviation
- Matrix multiplication and determinant computation

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KARTHIK-M116/Data-Visualization-Using-Python.git
   cd Data-Visualization-Using-Python
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Data Exploration using Python.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the data exploration steps.
4. Modify the code as needed for different matrix sizes or statistical operations.

## Notes
- The generated matrices contain random values, so results will vary with each execution.
- The notebook serves as an introductory guide to basic matrix operations and statistical calculations.
